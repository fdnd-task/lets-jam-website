# CD-R Week 2

For the Code & Design Review of the second week we will be joined by a number of external reviewers. These reviewers all have their own expertise. Use this to your advantage.

The reviews will be done on a team level. We will be holding four rounds of reviews of 30 minutes each. After the 30 minutes you will go with your team to the next reviewer.
